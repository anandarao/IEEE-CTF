Problem : Make bin2.out print 'Success'.

Steps :

1. Download the bin2.out from https://gist.github.com/kbhat95/5729edd4e323cd7e52dc .
2. Open it with radare2.
3. Go to sys.main().
4. We can see that the sys.func() is called with 0xa i.e 10.
5. sys.func() is a function to find factorial of a number using recursion.
6. So 10! = 3628800.
7. This value is divided by the input and compared with 0x15180 i.e 86400.
8. So answer x = 3628800/86400 = 42.
9. Input of 42 gives 'Success'.
